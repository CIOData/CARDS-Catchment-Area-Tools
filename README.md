# CATCHEMENT AREA RESEARCH & DATA SCIENCE (CARDS) GROUP 

## Catchment Area Tools

CARDS exists to help build a supportive and collaborative community for those involved in cancer center catchment area data collection,
analysis and utilization. This repository is intended to be a place where we can share and discuss code and best practices in support of this mission.

Please feel free to start conversations in the Discussion tab or submit code that you would like others in the community to review and give feedback on.
